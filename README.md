Mini-WinFE </p>
Many versions (WinBuilder build projects) of WinFE are found online. Even more instructions in how to build a WinFE (basic versions, Winbuilder, other builders) are scattered throughout the Internet. Various courses in using WinFE teach different versions of WinFE, sourced from the many build instructions found online.</p>
A detailed Mini-WinFE background is here: http://mistyprojects.co.uk/mistype/mini-winfe.docs/readme.files/intro.htm</p>

This Github respository does not maintain the Mini-WinFE, and is only a pointer to the recommended build of Mini-WinFE.  Downloadable ISO files of WinFE are untrusted and violate the MS EULA.  You need to personally build your own WinFE to abide by the EULA.</p>
Creating your own Mini-WinFE takes less than 10 minutes and you can have a forensically-sound, external media (CD/DVD/USB) bootable operating system that runs several Windows-based forensic software.</p>

Mini-WinFE </p>
Many versions (WinBuilder build projects) of WinFE are found online. Even more instructions in how to build a WinFE (basic versions, Winbuilder, other builders) are scattered throughout the Internet. Various courses in using WinFE teach different versions of WinFE, sourced from the many build instructions found online.</p>
A detailed Mini-WinFE background is here: http://mistyprojects.co.uk/mistype/mini-winfe.docs/readme.files/intro.htm</p>
